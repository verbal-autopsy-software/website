I am a sociologist whose research addresses cultural, social, and institutional dimensions of health and wellbeing. I have a long-standing interest in the social production of data about health, particularly with respect to interviewer and participant interaction. I work as a professor in the Department of Sociology at American University, and I am affiliated with the School of Public Health at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.
