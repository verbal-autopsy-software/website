I am a Computer Scientist from Kenya with a variety of skills ranging from statistical programmer, data management, database administration and data analysis. I am currently working as a consultant for Bloomberg Data 4 Health through CDC Foundation to support CRVS IT systems implementation and Mortality surveillance programs in D4H countries. I have also worked with Western Kenya HDSS as a software developer and data manager to develop HDSS surveillance systems for use in the community in wide variety of projects that involves community engagement in Verbal Autopsy and surveillance processes. Along my workstream over the years with Verbal Autopsy implementation in countries (Kenya, Zambia, Morocco), I have gained a lot of experience and learnt a lot and thus have supported countries to contribute and document various VA work experiences and guidance documents to help other VA implementations. I have been privileged to work closely with OpenVA team to test and implement VA Cause of death algorithms with in-country teams and also work with WHO VARG, which I am proudly now a member and part of the team to contribute more on WHO Verbal autopsy.
Based on my work experience, I have gained interest in CRVS and mortality systems improvement and community engagement. This involves integration of in-country’s digital health applications to improve system integration, data sharing and data use among stakeholders in and out of the country. These efforts have seen me lead the development of Lesotho Vital Statistics dashboard, VA data management tool, Zambia CRVS reporting dashboard and mobile event notification in Lesotho to improve CRVS reporting of births and deaths.
