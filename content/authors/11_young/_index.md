I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Sociology at The Ohio State University and a graduate affiliate for Institute for Population Research (IPR). I'm currently working as a graduate research assistant for OpenVA and Probbase team, communicating with World Health Organization (WHO). 

I'm broadly interested in social demography, mortality, health disparities, family, and immigration. Specifically, my research delves into the social determinants of widening the health disparities, as well as exploring health dynamics within families and immigrant populations.
