I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/statistics) at [University of California Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I am broadly interested in statistical methods and tools to address scientific questions in demography, epidemiology, and global health. Currently I work on latent variable modeling in messy, high-dimensional data, space-time models, causal inference, and applications in health data science.
