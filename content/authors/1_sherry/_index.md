I am a second-year undergraduate student at The Ohio State University majoring in computer science within the College of Engineering. Professionally, I am interested in the development of accessible software and data organization, through software development, web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. Aside from my major, I am also an International Affairs Scholar and taking part in the Second-year Transformational Experience Program. Additionally, I am a member of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers and the Chinese American Student Association, as well as being an undergraduate research assistant.
