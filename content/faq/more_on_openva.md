The publication on [The openVA Toolkit for Verbal Autopsies](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2023-020/openVA-RJ-R1.pdf) by Richard Li and the openVA Team
is a useful resource for the R implementation of openVA, which includes

* an overview of several VA algorithms (including InSilicoVA and InterVA)

* a description of the data formats

* examples of using the openVA to assign causes of death and examine the results
