I am an experienced public health researcher with a deep specialization in health systems development, integration, data analysis, presentation, and effective data utilization, with a tenure spanning over a decade at Ifakara Health Institute. During this tenure, I have made significant contributions to a range of critical projects in Tanzania, notably the Tanzania Sample Vital Events and Verbal Autopsy (SAVVY), Shared Health Records (SHR), eHealth initiatives, data systems in the Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (DHSS), and played a pivotal role in the initial national deployment of the District Health Information System (DHIS2). 

Beyond my contributions to the national landscape, I have also been privileged to contribute on a global scale by participating in the World Health Organization's verbal autopsy reference group. In this capacity, I actively contributed to the formulation of international standards and guidelines for mortality surveillance work. One of the significant outcomes of this involvement was the development of the Verbal Autopsy Manager (VMAN), a tool designed for the comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of processes related to the collection of Verbal Autopsy data. VMAN plays an indispensable role in supporting national mortality surveillance programs and aligns seamlessly with the broader objectives of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) initiatives.

Additionally, my entrepreneurial spirit led to the co-founding of iDeas in Action LTD in 2015 (https://www.iact.co.tz). This innovative company is dedicated to fostering opportunities for emerging researchers and developers, serving as an entry point for career development and a means to engage in substantive projects while concurrently pursuing financial gain. My role in co-founding iACT reflects my commitment to nurturing the next generation of professionals in the field, fostering innovation and growth within the research and development community.
