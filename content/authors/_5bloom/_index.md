The Bloomberg Philanthropies' Data for Health Initiative supports both Vital Strategies and the CDC Foundation, who in turn, support the openVA Team. The Data for Health Initiative is a significant program that aims to rapidly improve civil registration and vital statistics in number of low- and middle-income countries. VA is an integral part of the plan to improve vital statistics systems by creating a feasible means by which to quantify cause of death and estimate the burden of disease.
