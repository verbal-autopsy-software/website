The openVA team develops and maintains various tools, algorithms, and software related to Verbal Autopsy. Development is ongoing, and things are changing rapidly. This site provides information useful for installing and running openVA as well as recent publications and updates on what the team has done. All of our software itself is contained in ‘packages’ written for the free, open-source statistical programming environment R and Python. The packages are available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and the Python Package Index (PyPi).

OpenVA is, in part, an output of the [Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative](www.Bloomberg.org).
