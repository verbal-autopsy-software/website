openVA is software to run automated verbal autopsy coding algorithms. Development is ongoing, and things are changing rapidly. This site provides information useful for installing and running openVA. All of the software itself is contained in ‘packages’ written for the free, open-source statistical programming environment R. The packages are available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
